- Swift version: 6.0
- iOS Development
- Using Swift Package Manager

## Build System
- Using Xcode build system
- Respect Xcode project settings
- Support for SwiftPM package resolution

## File Organization
- Swift source files should be in the appropriate target directories
- Resources should be properly grouped in asset catalogs
- Follow standard iOS app structure

## Compiler and Build Settings
- Respect project-level build settings
- Use Swift Concurrency
- Enable strict concurrency checking
- Enable full debug symbols in debug configuration

## Source Control
- Ignore Xcode user-specific files
- Respect .gitignore settings
- Track Package.resolved for SwiftPM

## Code Analysis
- Enable Swift Compiler diagnostic warnings
- Treat warnings as errors in release builds
- Enable recommended optimizations

## Dependencies
- Use SwiftPM as primary dependency manager
- Track Package.swift changes
- Monitor dependency updates

## Performance
- Enable performance optimizations in release builds
- Use ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)
- Enable whole module optimization when appropriate

## Safety
