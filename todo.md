# Navigate from Liked Posts to Detailed Video View Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Create DetailedPostView
- [x] Create new file `Views/Feed/DetailedPostView.swift`
- [x] Implement basic structure reusing `FeedCell` components
- [x] Add navigation bar with back button
- [x] Ensure video playback controls work in detailed view
- [x] Handle video state management when navigating (pause/resume)
- [x] Implement like/unlike functionality maintaining sync with `FeedCell`

## Phase 2: Update ProfileView Navigation 
- [x] Add `NavigationStack` to `ProfileView` if not present
- [x] Modify liked posts list to use `NavigationLink`
- [x] Update the liked post cell UI to be more engaging:
  - [x] Add thumbnail/preview image
  - [x] Add interaction feedback (tap state)
  - [x] Add chevron or indicator for navigation
- [x] Ensure proper data passing between views

## Phase 3: State Management & Data Sync
- [x] Implement proper state management for likes across views
- [x] Create shared view model or state object for like synchronization
- [x] Handle real-time updates for like status
- [x] Implement proper cleanup when leaving detailed view
- [x] Add loading states for smooth transitions

## Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancements
- [x] Add smooth transitions between views
- [x] Implement proper loading states
- [x] Add haptic feedback for interactions
- [x] Ensure video properly pauses when navigating away
- [x] Add pull-to-refresh for liked posts list
- [x] Handle error states gracefully

## Phase 5: Feed Item Consistency
- [ ] Create a shared FeedItem component to be used in both Feed and Profile views
- [ ] Extract common functionality from FeedCell into the shared component
- [ ] Implement a unified data fetching strategy for both views
- [ ] Create a shared cache for post data to avoid duplicate network requests
- [ ] Ensure real-time updates propagate to both Feed and Profile views
- [ ] Add proper state management to keep both views in sync
- [ ] Handle edge cases (deleted posts, permissions changes, etc.)
- [ ] Test the consistency between Feed and Profile views

## Phase 6: Testing & Edge Cases
- [ ] Test navigation flow in both directions
- [ ] Test like/unlike synchronization
- [ ] Test video playback states
- [ ] Test offline behavior
- [ ] Test memory management
- [ ] Test UI on different device sizes

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize video loading in detailed view
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategy
- [ ] Optimize transitions and animations
- [ ] Profile and optimize memory usage
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup for resources

## Phase 8: Polish & Final Touches
- [ ] Add analytics tracking
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add loading indicators where needed
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling with app theme
- [ ] Add documentation for new components

## Technical Considerations

### Video Playback
- [ ] Handle proper cleanup of `AVPlayer` instances
- [ ] Manage active video state when navigating
- [ ] Handle background/foreground transitions

### Data Management
- [x] Ensure Firebase listeners are properly managed
- [x] Handle real-time updates efficiently
- [x] Implement proper error handling

### State Sync
- [x] Maintain consistent like state across views
- [x] Handle concurrent updates properly
- [x] Implement proper state restoration

### Performance
- [ ] Minimize memory usage
- [ ] Optimize video loading
- [ ] Handle large lists efficiently

## Implementation Notes
1. The implementation will reuse existing `FeedCell` components to maintain consistency
2. Navigation will be handled through SwiftUI's native navigation system
3. State management will ensure likes stay synchronized across all views
4. Video playback will be optimized for smooth transitions
5. Error handling and loading states will be implemented throughout
6. Feed items will maintain consistency across all views using shared components and state
